It's full moon again
Crazy how time flies
One might wonder if past path was in a right
direction
But I do believe things come to life by accident
when it remains on
Sounds like it's meant to be
(Wake Up)
New space made when things fall apart
(Get Up)
What matters after ending's how you left a mark
(Don't wait up)
Fire in my soul fire in my heart
'til you see me on the other side of stars,
I'm running
All the journeys start somewhere with a first
step
No one's sure what lies ahead, be bold and brave
(Stand up)
Roads may be rough and tough
though it will lead somewhere
(Nothing easy get up and go get it go)
Sometimes it's journey itself that teaches
a lot about the destination not aware of
No matter how far
(No matter how far)
How you go
(How you go how you go)
How long it may last
Venture life burn your dread
(Carpe Diem
No time to waste, you gotta venture life go get
it burn your dread)
